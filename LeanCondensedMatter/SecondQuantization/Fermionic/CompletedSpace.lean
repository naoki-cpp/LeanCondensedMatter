# Completed fermionic Fock-space analysis

The public entry point for the completed fermionic representation. The current slice contains the
`ℓ²` occupation representation, the dense algebraic core, the bounded single-mode number
projection, the occupation-toggle equivalence, and its norm-preserving continuous linear lift.

Completed creation and annihilation maps will be built from the toggle, the occupation projections,
and the fermionic phase. Partial linear maps for unbounded Hamiltonians and trace-class thermal
constructions remain later slices.
