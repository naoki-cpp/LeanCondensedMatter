# Completed fermionic Fock-space analysis

The public entry point for the completed fermionic representation. The current slice contains the
`ℓ²` occupation representation, the dense algebraic core, the bounded single-mode number
projection, the occupation-toggle equivalence, bounded creation and annihilation maps, their
occupation-basis action, agreement with the algebraic ladder operators on the finite-support core,
and the canonical anticommutation relations lifted to the completion by density and continuity.
It also exposes domain-carrying diagonal partial operators, including the completed free Hamiltonian
and total-number operator on their natural weighted `ℓ²` domains, together with dense-domain,
formal-symmetry, and closability results for conjugation-fixed diagonal weights.

Closedness, adjoint identification, self-adjointness, and trace-class thermal constructions remain
later analytic work.
