# Connecting thermal occupation correlators to Track B's moment-cumulant machinery

Phase 8 of Track D's fermionic primary line (`notes/roadmaps/second-quantization.md`): the first
bridge between Track D (thermal expectation values on `FockSpaceFermionic`) and Track B (the
abstract moment-cumulant duality on the partition lattice, `Combinatorics/MomentCumulant.lean`,
`Combinatorics/CumulantFactorization.lean`).

`occupationMoment w S := (Σₙ (if S ⊆ n then w n else 0)) / Z(w)` is the normalized thermal
expectation value of the simultaneous occupation of every mode in `S`, `⟨∏ᵢ∈S nᵢ⟩_w`, computed
directly as a weighted sum rather than via an operator product (the `numberOperator i`'s commute as
they're simultaneously diagonal, but `FockSpaceFermionic Mode →ₗ[ℂ] FockSpaceFermionic Mode` has no
`CommMonoid` structure under composition to state that with `Finset.prod`, so this file bypasses
the issue rather than solving it). It lands exactly in Track B's `Finset Mode → ℂ` moment-function
type, with
`occupationMoment w ⊥ = 1` matching `IsIndependentAcross`'s normalization hypothesis.

This is a first, deliberately modest step: it connects the types and proves the basic sanity facts
(`occupationMoment` at `⊥` and at a singleton). It does *not* yet establish `IsIndependentAcross`
for a genuine Gibbs weight, nor assemble the `log Z = Σ` over connected clusters statement itself —
see `notes/roadmaps/second-quantization.md` for what remains.

/-- **The thermal occupation-correlator moment.** `occupationMoment w S` is the normalized weighted
occupation correlator under the weight `w` — the thermal expectation value `⟨∏ᵢ∈S nᵢ⟩_w` of the
simultaneous occupation of `S`, computed directly as a weighted sum. For positive real weights (a
genuine Boltzmann weight) it is the probability that every mode in `S` is occupied; `w` here is an
arbitrary complex-valued weight, so no probabilistic interpretation is assumed in general. As with
`thermalExpectation`, division by `partitionFunction w` is only physically meaningful when
`partitionFunction w ≠ 0`. -/
