# Axiomatic quantum theory: density operators via trace-class operators (infinite dimensions)

Extends the density-operator postulate (`QuantumTheory.DensityOperator` in
`QuantumTheory/DensityOperator.lean`) beyond finite-dimensional `H`, using the general
`ContinuousLinearMap.trace` for compact self-adjoint trace-class operators
(`LeanCondensedMatter/Analysis/CompactSelfAdjoint.lean`) in place of `LinearMap.trace`, which
requires finite-dimensionality.

**This file is additive, not a replacement**: the finite-dimensional `QuantumTheory.DensityOperator`
and everything built on it (`POVM`, `prob`, `sum_prob_eq_one`, `purity`, ...) are untouched. This
namespace develops the infinite-dimensional analogue in parallel.

**Scope note (a genuine mathematical gap, not just a Lean technicality):** in finite dimensions
`LinearMap.trace` is defined unconditionally, so `Tr[E_m ρ]` (the Born-rule probability, needed
for `prob`/`sum_prob_eq_one`) makes sense for *any* positive `E_m` and density operator `ρ`. In
this infinite-dimensional setting, `ContinuousLinearMap.trace` is only meaningful for *compact
self-adjoint trace-class* operators — and `E_m ∘ ρ` need not be self-adjoint at all (a product of
two self-adjoint operators is self-adjoint only when they commute). Porting `prob`/`sum_prob_eq_one`
therefore needs a notion of trace for non-self-adjoint (e.g. Hilbert–Schmidt-class) operators that
does not yet exist in this project; see `notes/roadmaps/operator-algebra.md`. This file is
deliberately scoped to what's well-posed without that: the `DensityOperator` structure itself and
properties of a single density operator (`pure`, and eventually `purity`, which only needs `ρ ∘ ρ`
— self-adjoint since `ρ` is).

`c ↦ c • x`, and `IsCompactOperator` is preserved under post-composition by a continuous linear
